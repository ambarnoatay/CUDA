# CUDA

# Objective
Implement a CUDA program to simulate a 2D random walk. A random walk is a mathematical process that describes a path consisting of a sequence of random steps. Simulate a large number of walkers taking steps either north, south, east, or west on a grid, and calculate the average distance they travel from the origin.

#Description

A C++ application using CUDA that takes as program input arguments the Number of Walkers, and the number of steps each walker needs to take on a 2D integer grid. Uses command line flags to distinguish Number Walkers (-W) and (-I) for number of steps. All the walkers start at the origin (0, 0).
